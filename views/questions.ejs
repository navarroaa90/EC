    <h2 class="my-4"> What makes these devices unique compared to other medical immobilization devices?</h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both the EC Pediatric Restraining Chair and the EC Immobilzation Device assist in full body immobilization without causing the patient pain or distress. These products were made based on the concept of a splint; immobilizing all movevable joints such as the head and neck, elbow, knees, and spine, all while making sure the patient is still comforatble. </li>
        </ul> <br>
    <h2 class="my-4">Why is it necessary to use medcial immobilization devices for pediatric patients?</h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a common occurance for children to be fearful of most medical procedures and is proven so when they move around and cry while in the examination room. This not only brings distress to the patient, but also to the patient's parents. To add to that, medical staff are sometimes utilized to physically restrain children. This leads to repeat examinations as well as prolonged radation exposure. Immobilization devices are needed to provide medical staff with efficient and safe ways to proceed with X-ray examinations and emergency procedures. Both the EC Pediatric Restraining Chair and the EC Immobilizer Device provice comfort and effiency so that there is no need for drug sedation or repeat examinations.   </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2 class= "my-4">Is repeat radiation exposure from x-ray examinations harmful?</h2><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Most concerns for repeat radiation exposure are for infants and small children. Radiation ionizing exposure can cause damage on a cellular level, potentially causing DNA mutation or cell death. This can lead to induced cancers such as leukemia, myeloma, thryoid, breast, brain, lung, and skin cancer. The use of the EC Pediatric Restraining Chair and the EC Immobilizer Device will stop the need for repeat examinations and will no longer produce undiagnosable blurry images.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h2 class= "my-4"> Are materials used in these devices safe?</h2><br>

                <li>Yes the materials used in these devices are FDA approved and made is the USA. All components of these devices are durable and easily sanitized after each procedure. There are also foam components added to both devices that can aid in making the paitents comfortable during any examination procedure.</li>
